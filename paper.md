# Summary

`ztfquery` is a python package built to download data generated by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, @bellm:2019; @graham:2019). It contains four subpart, each requiring different credentials.
- **ZTF products:** a wrapper of the [IRSA web API](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/program_interface/ztf_api.html) that enable to get ztf data _(requires access for full data, but not public data)_:
	- Images and pipeline products, e.g. catalog ;
	- LightCurves (not from image subtraction).
	- (ZTF night activities aka "night summary" _(not from IPAC | requires access)_)

- **Marshal Data:** tools to download [Marshal](http://skipper.caltech.edu:8080/cgi-bin/growth/marshal.cgi) data, including alert lightcurves and target coordinates _(requires access)_

- **SEDM Data:** tools to download SEDM data, including IFU cubes and target spectra, from [pharos](http://pharos.caltech.edu) _(requires access)_

- **ZTF alert:** Currently only a simple alert reader.

## ZTF products
This part of the software is the core of `ztfquery` and enables to access images and catalogs produced by the ZTF camera installed on the Palomar P48 telescope. These data are  produced by the ZTF pipeline detailed in @masci:2019. See the data [ZTF webpage](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/ztf.html) to see which data are publically available.
